Argentina,AR,ARG,2016,Chikungunya mosquito-borne viral fever,DON2201,"Individuals are infected with the virus through a mosquito bite from Aedes mosquitos (Aedes albopictus and A. aegypti). Concomitant fever and arthalgia are a common specific sign although infection can present with non-specific symptoms that can be confused with Dengue including headache, rash and myalgia. Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms. Encephalitis, Guillain-Barre sundrome and arthritis are rare complications of infection with Chikungya virus."

Chad,TD,TCD,2020,Chikungunya mosquito-borne viral fever,DON2658,"Individuals are infected with the virus through a mosquito bite from Aedes mosquitos (Aedes albopictus and A. aegypti). Concomitant fever and arthalgia are a common specific sign although infection can present with non-specific symptoms that can be confused with Dengue including headache, rash and myalgia. Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Congo,CG,COG,2019,Chikungunya mosquito-borne viral fever,DON2518,"Individuals are infected with the virus through a mosquito bite from Aedes mosquitos (Aedes albopictus and A. aegypti). Concomitant fever and arthalgia are a common specific sign although infection can present with non-specific symptoms that can be confused with Dengue including headache, rash and myalgia. Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms. Encephalitis, Guillain-Barre sundrome and arthritis are rare complications of infection with Chikungya virus."

France,FR,FRA,2017,Chikungunya mosquito-borne viral fever,DON2354,"Individuals are infected with the virus through a mosquito bite from Aedes mosquitos (Aedes albopictus and A. aegypti). Concomitant fever and arthalgia are a common specific sign although infection can present with non-specific symptoms that can be confused with Dengue including headache, rash and myalgia. Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms. Encephalitis, Guillain-Barre sundrome and arthritis are rare complications of infection with Chikungya virus."

Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity.

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection.

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk.

Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity.

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

United States of America,US,USA,2016,Chikungunya mosquito-borne viral fever,DON2254,"Individuals are infected with the virus through a mosquito bite from Aedes mosquitos (Aedes albopictus and A. aegypti). Concomitant fever and arthalgia are a common specific sign although infection can present with non-specific symptoms that can be confused with Dengue including headache, rash and myalgia. Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms. Encephalitis, Guillain-Barre sundrome and arthritis are rare complications of infection with Chikungya virus."
